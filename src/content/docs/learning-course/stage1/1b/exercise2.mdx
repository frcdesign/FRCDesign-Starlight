## Exercise 2: Two Stage Gearbox

In this exercise, you will be modeling and assembling a two stage gearbox. The goal of this exercise is to practice modeling more advanced gearboxes. You will also learn how to use the [`Part Lighten` Featurescript](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/028ca8fb10baf53e1f6fce96/v/821c8b51ed0953526b51926e/e/a8b9e45297aac9f5688c871d) used for lightening parts.

<Aside type="caution">
Though this stage will have you lighten your plates when you finish your part studio, this is not best practice. When modeling a full mechanism or robot, you should **wait to lighten plates until after all the design review and changes have been made to the mechanism or full robot**. Otherwise you end up wasting time fixing your lightening every time the plate or mechanism changes.

### Part Studio Instructions
**Navigate to the "Exercise #2 Part Studio" tab** in your copied document and **follow the instructions in the slides** to complete the part studio.

<Aside type="tip" title="Verification">
Make sure to have you and/or a more experienced member/mentor of your team [**review your CAD!**](/learning-course/stage1/1a/focusing-on-improvement) Your assembly should have 27 instances.
</Aside>

In this exercise, you practiced more complex gearbox modeling and mating together larger assemblies.
