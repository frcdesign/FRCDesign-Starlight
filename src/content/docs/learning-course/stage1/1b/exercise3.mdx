## Exercise 3: Belt and Gear Transmission

In this exercise, you will be modeling a two stage gearbox that uses gears and belts. This gearbox will also include elements like frame and gussets, which you previously learned in Stage 1A. The goal of this exercise is to continue to ramp up your modeling skills.

<Aside type="caution" title="Remember!">
Always make sure to fully **define** your sketches, **rename** your features, and keep your feature and instance trees organized with **folders**.

<YouTube id="UBT5AGqBYW4" caption='22. Use the Belt & Chain Gen Featurescript to create a model of the belt. The pitch of the belt is 5mm and the width is 9mm. Offset the reference plane by 0.5" so that the belt does not collide with the plate. Keep the belt simplified, as turning on teeth modeling will slow down the part studio. Notice that the Belt & Chain Gen Featurescript also calculates the pitch length of the belt which allows us to verify that we calculated the correct C-C in step 7 and 8.' />

<Aside type="tip" title="Verification">
Make sure to have you and/or a more experienced member/mentor of your team [**review your CAD!**](/learning-course/stage1/1a/focusing-on-improvement) Your assembly should have 31 instances.
</Aside>

In this exercise, you modeled a fairly complex gearbox that was integrated with some frame elements. At this point, you should be begin to feel comfortable with the sketching and extrude tools. You should also familiarize yourself with all the options present in the Featurescripts that you have used up until this point by playing around with different settings.



### Parametric Modeling

To get a feel for how parametric your model is, you can try and change certain key dimensions in the layout sketches, such as the length of the tubes, angle of the tubes, length of the belt, and the size of the gears. Play around with which modifications will update smoothly and which require additional fixes in the CAD.

You may also be curious as to how things like the hole sizes, materials, etc were selected in each of these designs. You are encouraged to learn more by browsing the [Design Handbook](/design-handbook/) pages which contain in-depth information on a wide range of topics, or by discussing with your team and or other students and mentors on the DDS Discord.
