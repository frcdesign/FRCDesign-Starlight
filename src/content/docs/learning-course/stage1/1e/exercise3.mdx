## Exercise: Bellypan Pocketing

Some teams may choose to pocket their bellypan to reduce weight and make wiring easier. A pocketed bellypan can save around 3-4 lbs. However, this will add significant machining time if you are manufacturing the bellypan yourself or increase cost if you are purchasing the bellypan from a fabrication service (eg: [Fabworks](https://fabworks.com/ "Fabworks Sheet Metal Services")). You should carefully consider the tradeoffs with your team.

### Instructions

**If you choose to pocket your bellypan for your drivetrain**, you can **follow the instructions in the slides** which utilize the `Part Lighten` [Featurescript](/resources/featurescripts "Featurescripts Page"). You could also use the `Vent` or `Part Lighten` [Featurescripts](/resources/featurescripts "Featurescripts Page") to pocket the bellypan. While the workflow may vary slightly between each Featurescript, the general idea is the same. A diamond pattern is recommended for strength and ease of modeling.
