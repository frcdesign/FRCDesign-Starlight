## Assembly

Now that the part studio is finished, you can create the drivetrain assembly.

Just like with the practice exercises in the previous stage, after inserting and grouping all of the parts, you should fasten the origin cube to the origin of the assembly. This aligns the part studio origin and assembly origin.

### Instructions

Start by **creating a new assembly tab called `Drivetrain Assembly`** in the `Drivetrain` folder. **Follow the instructions in the slides** to complete the assembly.

### Rivet Grip Length

As was mentioned in 1A, When selecting rivets to insert from the part library, you'll notice they have a configuration for **grip length**. The grip length of a rivet is the total thickness of material it can fasten together. Make sure you choose the appropriate grip length or they can either come out easily or not fasten the material together.
