import Aside from '../../../../../components/Aside.astro';
import Slides from '../../../../../components/Slides.astro';

In this exercise, you will be modeling some dead axle rollers. To spin things, whether it be rollers, wheels, or even arms, two types of axles can be utilized: "live" and "dead" axles.

## Live and Dead Axle Rollers

You'll learn more about live and dead axle design in Stage 2, but for now, all you need know is that live axle means we power the shaft to spin our mechanism, whereas with dead axle, we directly power the spinning component.
For live axle, the shaft spins on fixed bearings, while for dead axle, the bearings are on the spinning component. Take a look at the visual below to better understand.

## Part Studio Instructions

**Navigate to the "Exercise #2 Part Studio" tab** in your copied document and **follow the instructions in the slides** to complete the part studio for this exercise.

  { src: "/learning-course/stage1/1c/dead-axle-rollers/parts-8.webp", caption: "8. Start the plate sketch by copying the bolt pattern and pivot axle hole, and adding bolt holes for the rollers. Also add the bolt pattern for the motor, this should be done in the same way as the previous exercise but with a 6 hole pattern. Like before we will only make 3 of these real holes. The rest will be construction circles." },

## Assembly Instructions

**Next, navigate to the "Exercise #2 Assembly" tab** in your copied document and **follow the instructions in the slides** to complete this exercise.

  { src: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_dtYxcaCL8", caption: "3. Insert a roller from FRCDesignLib. Make sure the length is set to 24\", and has bolt endcaps set to the HTD option. You can mate the first roller to one of the holes in the side plate. You can replicate the single roller to the other two holes. Make sure you select the whole assembly for the replicate as shown." },
  { src: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DqiNcoXHYNE", caption: "4. Mate the belts to the rollers using the center mate point for the belts, and the roller pulleys." },

  { src: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUW7gB-it7I", caption: "6. Measure the distance between the plate and motor by clicking the face of each component. Copy this distance to your clipboard. Open the FRCDesignLib Inserter and insert a custom round ID spacer with the length you copied. There is no need to change other configurations. Attach this spacer to the plate and use replicate to add it to the other three plate holes." },
  { src: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FkXr6tEHoSc", caption: "7. Add fasteners to your assembly. Note the use of washers on each bolts When bolting to polycarbonate plates it is best practice to use washers. This helps prevent the plates from cracking. The Rollers should be attached with 1/2\" #10-32 bolts, and the motor with 1.75\" #10-32 bolts." },

## Minimizing Unique Part Count

You may have noticed that the 3rd roller has a 24T pulley on both ends despite there only being a belt connected to one end.
While the configurable roller does allow you to choose no pulley for the end with no belt, it can be advantageous to still keep the pulley in situations like this to reduce the number of unique parts.
By doing so, all three rollers are identical, making part tracking and spare parts easier.
