In this exercise, you will be modeling a telescoping climber. This mechanism features [WCP GreyT telescoping bearing blocks](https://wcproducts.com/products/greyt-telescope) and [REV MAXPlanetary](https://www.revrobotics.com/frc/maxplanetary-system/) mounting gearbox plates. Be sure to pay close attention to hook and gearbox sketches when modeling.

<Aside type="caution">
From this point on the specific lengths of shafts and offsets of belts may not be provided, you should consider what components are going on the shafts when setting distances. It is always ok to go back and change these lengths later if needed. When you get to making your own mechanisms there wont be a step by step guide for it! These exercises try and gradually pull back the guard rails as your progress to get you ready for build season. If you get stuck feel free to refer to the [solution doc](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/99b4fd36c41bdb5b3e6d5ceb/w/f8e04439667e38aedb8f8196/e/8843ec3a6b3828f461343955), or ask a mentor for help!

## Leveraging COTS Components
Using COTS components is crucial in a time-constrained build season.
Even if you have the capability to fabricate every part, relying on COTS parts allows you to spend your time on more important tasks - like refining designs or testing.
This helps ensure your time is spent where it makes the most impact, rather than on re-inventing parts that are already readily available.

## Crush Blocks

3D-printed crush blocks can be used to reinforce thin-walled tubing in assemblies where bolts pass through without a plate.
Since the strength of bolts comes from their clamping force, without anything to support the thin walls, the tube can collapse before achieving proper clamping force.
Crush blocks distribute the load, allowing for full clamping force while maintaining the tube's structural integrity.

Alternatively, a "crush plate" can also be utilized to distribute the fastener force to achieve a similar effect as a crush block.

## Part Studio Instructions

**Navigate to the "Exercise #4 Part Studio" tab** in your copied document and **follow the instructions in the slides** to complete the part studio for this exercise.

Make sure to account for 3D-printing tolerances by giving a little bit of clearance for the crush block inside of the tube. You will add the holes that go through the crush block after you model the hook." },

  { src: "/learning-course/stage1/1c/telescope/parts-8.webp", caption: "8. Sketch the gearbox mounting plate on the outside of the tube. There should be a small 0.01\" gap between the 3/8\" clamping spacers and the tube to make sure that the gearbox can be assembled properly. The 13.75 mm construction circle represents the rounded hex spool. A hole will be placed on the point on the left side of the plate." },

<Aside type="tip" title="Verification">
Make sure to have you and/or a more experienced member/mentor of your team [**review your CAD!**](/learning-course/stage1/1a/focusing-on-improvement) Your assembly should have 27 instances.

## Section Views

Section views are a helpful tool that allow you to reveal the internal features of a part or assembly by slicing through it along a specified plane. You can select a plane, planar face, cylinder, cone, or mate connector to use as the sectioning plane. You can also choose to include or exclude specific parts from the section view.
